You are lane `lib-stellaris` in the YAIRPG multi-world research dispatch of 2026-10-14.
Repo: /Users/weiwei/code/yet-another-idle-rpg (main checkout, read-only for you except your output dir).
Read first: docs/gm/dispatch/game-research-wave-2026-10-14/COMMON.md (hard rules, output shape) and docs/gm/dispatch/game-research-wave-2026-10-14/ASPECTS.md (aspect standard). They govern this prompt.
Output dir (the only repo path you may write): `docs/research/stellaris/`
Work area: `~/.codex/research/lib-stellaris/`
Weibao, 2026-10-14: "send out stuff for https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue/ ... https://www.retromud.org/frames/main_home.html? https://3k.org/realms/index.php? We can learn from some of the ui from https://store.steampowered.com/app/4122910/Multiverse_Idle/ Send out deep decompilers and auditors, Remanant 2 and Kingdom hearts are still installing". He compared YAIRPG (a traveler living in many worlds with their own power systems and careers) against Siralim Ultimate, Remnant II, Kingdom Hearts, HyperRogue and The Strange (tabletop).

## The YAIRPG question for every lane
How does this source make **different worlds or places play differently**, and how does one traveler carry growth, items, powers and relationships across them? Read the YAIRPG owners first (don't edit them): `docs/worlds/WORLD_CORE_KIT_SUCCESSOR_2026-10-14.md`, `docs/worlds/WORLD_CORE_KIT_2026-10-14.md` (K1-K34 topic map), `docs/NESTED_WORLDS_AND_DEEP_TROPE_CHAINS_2026_10_05.md`, `docs/research/START_AND_BRANCH_INTEGRATION_MAP_2026-10-14.md`, and `docs/research/cross-game-synthesis-2026-10-14/REPORT.md`. Map findings to kit parts (K codes) and existing synthesis packets; mark new ones.

Write the standard game-lane outputs (REPORT, FINDINGS, IMPLEMENTATION_PACKETS, SMALL_TOUCHES, TOOLING, CHECKPOINT) and an `aspects-2026-10-14/` folder (A01-A12, SYSTEM_INVENTORY, DEEPER_SYSTEMS) where the source supports it.

## Source and payload gate
Stellaris, in Weibao's Steam library, not yet installed. The watcher starts this lane when Steam reports it fully installed under `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/`. Read-only; never run it.
## Route
Paradox Clausewitz script and localisation in the install (`common/`, `events/`), like the HoI4 lane (`docs/research/hearts-of-iron-iv/TOOLING.md`). macOS native.
## Deep questions
Species traits, genetic modification and multi-species pops (genetics); event chains, anomalies and archaeology sites (P10, research by study); tech cards drawn from weighted options (technology); origins and civics as start rules. Write PROVINCE_WAR_FIT.md.
Also run the aspect pass (A01-A12) into `docs/research/stellaris/aspects-2026-10-14/`.
