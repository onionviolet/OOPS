# Foundation current checkpoint

R15 active, 2026-10-13. Weibao asked to resume the chain on the open gates and
commit/push to master as work lands. Root coordinator is the Claude Code
session in the main checkout. [R15 brief](rounds/r15/BRIEF.md) owns scope and
the seeded-test-state verification method; R14's stopped checkpoint is preserved
verbatim in [rounds/r15/CHECKPOINT_BEFORE_R15.md](rounds/r15/CHECKPOINT_BEFORE_R15.md).

Groups G1–G5 run in separate worktrees; root merges, rebuilds, runs the full
suite and pushes to master per landed group. FA19/21/22/23 stay with their
owners; World1 stays paused.
