# Foundation run, 2026-11-12

Coordinator: the Claude session that wrote the [procedural foundation plan](../../../PROCEDURAL_FOUNDATION_PLAN.md). Workers: twelve local Claude sessions, one per chat (K W P G L F B S A C R M), each in its own worktree and branch. The coordinator verifies, merges, gates and dispatches.

## Phase 1 (2026-11-11 to 2026-11-12)

| Chat | Branch | Commits | Delivered | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K | claude/fdn-k-kernel-a28c4b | 6df7bbdb3, f05d8afa8 | Working contract v0; Gu procedures and creature methods pass 17 contract tests incl. one jump vs many and reload | merged |
| W | claude/fdn-w-substrate-ee40b6 | 7d9378127, 5956d23ae | Substrate v0; brew steam and shell regulator exchange humidity and smoke with no import; same after jump, steps, reload | merged; not wired into live play (below floor) |
| P | claude/fdn-p-grammar-4ffe18 | 415f8e755, 937d36f4e | Grammar contract v0, module, Gu canon test (report in foundation-p) | merged |
| G | claude/fdn-g-gu-312887 | eb8b903b9, 860ff5875 | Catalogue 28 to 78 kinds as identity data; 7 run as data; compression inventory; grammar and quantity drafts | merged |
| L, F, B, S, A, C, R, M | claude/fdn-*-* | one or two each | Inventories, PFP2 counts, grammar or contract proposals; S adds a spellbook browser receipt | merged |

Merged into master as 12 no-ff merges ending at 886d8c1e7.

## Resume block (unattended run, 2026-11-12)

Weibao (2026-11-12): "send the plan updates to the chats and start phase 2. Continuw auto thorugh all the phases until everything is comprehensive and works to cover all the gu, all the possibilities of moves and more, all the potions and more? rescope as needed and more?"

- Objective (from 2026-11-12, plan section "Making all achievable"): milestones MS1-MS6 met in order, each committed. MS1 every CV3 ledger has zero unclassified rows; MS2 effect-layer canon test on Gu and Hogwarts spells reported; MS3 every chapter-checked Gu kind, real Hogwarts potion and spellbook spell runs or is blocked with a named rule, and at least 10 Keeper modules are deleted; MS4 the 23 canon moves rebuilt as composed workings, with generated moves passing the five checks; MS5 one reachable route per domain at the floor plus a combined browser pass; MS6 N, X, D, PG1, PG2 and E's three chains. Progress is reported as the runs share per ledger.
- Earlier text: Objective: every chat in the plan meets its done check (plan tables plus PFP2 counts), Gu catalogue runs as data with moves beyond canon through the effect grammar and composed workings, potions as data across Hogwarts and Lord of the Mysteries, the three emergence chains run with no join code, one combined browser pass; each phase committed on master.
- Input identity: master at 886d8c1e7 plus plan edits; dirty but not ours: none at start.
- State of the steps: phase 1 merged (886d8c1e7); plan committed (d1fb38e7a); merge fixes committed (receipts, grammar comment); phase 2 dispatched to all twelve chats 2026-11-12.
- Last evidence: merged tree full suite 6182 pass, 1 fail (debt scan on a comment, fixed, focused file 2/2), 2 skipped; build, check:arch and check:rules pass.
- Gate policy (Weibao asked whether gates are skippable, 2026-11-12): chats run focused tests only. The coordinator batches returns into one merge wave and runs the full suite once per wave, never per chat. Docs-only merges run check:rules and doc checks, not the suite. A fix that touches only comments or docs reuses the last full-suite evidence plus its focused file (AGENTS: reuse passing evidence for unchanged inputs). Merging and dispatch do not wait on a running suite: chats work on branches, and a red suite is fixed on master and relayed. The browser pass runs once per domain milestone, not per phase.
- Failed approaches: starting sessions from a background-task turn is refused by the app; dispatch only on a user turn or by messaging existing sessions.
- Goals: each chat runs the plan's per-chat goal (its done-check row, phase after phase); this record holds the coordinator goal. E started 2026-11-12 (local_d9c26029, fdn-e-emergence). N, X and D wait for the usage read after phase 2 returns.
- Next useful action: as phase 2 returns arrive, verify each at its locators, merge the wave, run the full suite once, relay requests, message the next phase.
- Usage pacing: read 2026-11-12 06:00 local: 5-hour 31%, weekly all-models 51%. Continue while weekly < 75% and 5-hour < 85%. 5-hour >= 85%: no new phase dispatch; wake after reset. Weekly >= 75%: stop, keep this block current, wait for Weibao.
- Stop condition: objective met, or weekly >= 75%, or a blocker only Weibao can clear (push, direction change). Reached? no.

Resume prompt for a fresh session: "Continue the unattended foundation run from the Resume block in docs/gm/dispatch/foundation-run-2026-11-12/RUN.md. Check git status and git log -3 against its input identity first; finish the next useful action; keep the block current; commit own paths, no push."

## Codex lanes (requested 2026-11-12, not dispatched)

Weibao (2026-11-12): "Have those chats direct codex chats accordingly, with individual codex chats to bring their visions to life? using /goal and also /autocompact accordingly?"

- Route found: CLI at `/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex-cli/CodexCLI.app/Contents/MacOS/codex` (codex-cli 0.167.0-alpha.4.1). The `goals` feature is stable. Goals are set through the app-server protocol (`thread/goal/set`, `thread/goal/get`, `thread/goal/clear`); auto-compaction is a config limit (`AutoCompactTokenLimitScope`, set with `-c` at launch), not a separate command.
- Usage preflight (read-only, 2026-11-12): account type chatgpt, ordinary usage allowed, no rate-limit reached, Codex window 15% used.
- Gate not passed: no supported setting found that stops a worker from spending account credits once included usage runs out. AU7 also caps an unattended task at 5 percentage points of a usage window unless a larger ceiling is authorized. The 64,500-credit reserve stands.
- Proposed protocol if authorized: one Codex goal thread per Claude chat, launched detached in its own process group from that chat's worktree; goal text = the chat's plan row plus milestone; auto-compact limit set at launch; the Claude chat reviews each Codex return at its locators before committing; the coordinator rereads Codex usage before each batch and stops all Codex threads at the authorized ceiling, before included usage runs out.
- Authorized (Weibao, 2026-11-12): "for paid credits, allow them to use till like there is like 64000 left or something, for usage, allow usage till maybe 30%maybe". Ceilings: Codex included-usage window up to 30% used (read 15% at authorization), credit balance down to 64,000. This raises AU7's 5-point default for this run. The launcher guard pauses every Codex goal thread when either line is reached; each thread also carries a goal token budget.
- Lane shape: each Claude chat writes `docs/gm/dispatch/foundation-<x>-2026-11-12/CODEX_LANE.md`; the coordinator launches it in a new worktree cut from that chat's branch; Codex edits files and does not commit; the owning Claude chat reviews the diff at its locators and commits. A pilot lane runs first to measure usage per lane before more open (AU4).
